# How Linkr is Different

Linkr is not another Wi-Fi finder app. It is not a coverage map. It is not a social network for hotspots.

Linkr is infrastructure for connectivity: built by its participants, observable in real time, and accessible to anyone.

---

## Real contributions, not estimates

Traditional coverage maps are based on models, projections, and carrier claims. They show where connectivity *should* exist.

Linkr shows where connectivity *does* exist. Every hotspot on the network is a real contribution from a real participant. If it appears on the map, someone put it there.

---

## Live observability, not static data

Most connectivity information is out of date the moment it is published. Networks go down. Passwords change. Access points move.

Linkr tracks availability and reliability in real time. You can see not just that a hotspot exists, but whether it is currently online, how consistently it has been available, and what its performance looks like.

---

## Community-powered, not centrally controlled

Linkr does not own the network. The network is the sum of its contributors.

Individuals share hotspots from their homes, offices, and devices. Organizations deploy connectivity across campuses and cities. Each contribution adds to the whole.

This is not crowdsourcing data about someone else's network. This is people building the network itself.

---

## Access, not just discovery

Finding a network is only useful if you can connect to it.

Linkr provides a unified way to access contributed hotspots. You do not need to hunt for passwords, register for accounts, or negotiate terms at each location. If a hotspot is on Linkr and available to you, you can use it.

## Comparison

| Traditional Model | Linkr |
|-------------------|-------|
| Coverage estimates | Real contributions |
| Static maps | Live observability |
| Centralized networks | Community-powered |
| Discovery only | Discovery + access |

<Note>
Linkr is what connectivity infrastructure looks like when it is built by the people who use it.
