# What is Linkr?

Linkr is a connectivity network built by its participants.

It allows anyone to share a wireless hotspot and make it discoverable to others within the Linkr ecosystem. When you share a hotspot through Linkr, it becomes part of a live, global map of real-world connectivity.

This is not a simulation. It is not a coverage estimate. It is actual infrastructure, contributed by real people and organizations, observable in real time.

## The core idea

Traditional connectivity maps show you where service *should* exist. Linkr shows you where connectivity *actually* exists, right now, based on contributions from the community.

Every hotspot on Linkr is:

- **Real** — contributed by a person or organization
- **Observable** — its availability and reliability are tracked
- **Accessible** — discoverable by anyone using Linkr

Linkr turns fragmented local connectivity into shared global infrastructure.

## Who Linkr is for

**Individuals** who want to share their connectivity with others, whether at home, at work, or on the go.

**Organizations** looking to deploy connectivity at scale — across campuses, cities, events, or distributed locations.

**Anyone** who needs to find reliable internet access in unfamiliar places.

## What Linkr is not

Linkr is not an internet service provider. It does not sell bandwidth or replace your ISP.

Linkr is not a VPN, a mesh network protocol, or a hardware company.

Linkr is infrastructure for discovery and access. It connects people who have connectivity with people who need it.

<Note>
Linkr treats connectivity as infrastructure — something that should be visible, reliable, and accessible. The network exists because people contribute to it.
