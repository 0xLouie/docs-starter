title: Why Connectivity is Still a Problem
description: The gap between coverage maps and real-world access
---

Connectivity is everywhere. And yet, finding reliable internet access remains frustratingly difficult.

---

## The coverage illusion

Mobile carriers publish coverage maps. Cities announce public Wi-Fi initiatives. Venues advertise free internet.

But coverage maps are estimates. Public networks are inconsistent. Hotel Wi-Fi requires a room key. Airport networks demand your email. Coffee shop passwords change weekly.

The infrastructure exists, but access is fragmented, opaque, and unreliable.

## The visibility problem

When you arrive somewhere new, you have no way to know:

- Is there usable connectivity here?
- Is it reliable?
- Can I actually access it?

You are left to guess, ask around, or cycle through networks hoping one works.

This is not a technology problem. It is a visibility problem. The connectivity exists, you just cannot see it.

## Why this persists

Connectivity has traditionally been treated as a product, not infrastructure.

Products are sold, gated, and controlled. Infrastructure is shared, observable, and reliable.

Roads have signs. Airports have flight boards. Power grids have uptime guarantees.

Connectivity has none of this. It remains invisible until you try to use it, and unreliable once you do.

## What would need to change

For connectivity to function like infrastructure, it would need to be:

- **Visible**: you can see what exists before you need it
- **Observable**: you can assess its reliability over time
- **Accessible**: you can use it without negotiating access

This is what Linkr is building.

<Note>
Linkr does not create connectivity. It makes existing connectivity visible, observable, and accessible.
