# Deploying at Scale

When an organization shares more than a handful of hotspots, operational considerations become important. Here is practical guidance for larger deployments.

---

## Planning your deployment

Before sharing hotspots, consider:

**Scope**: how many hotspots, at how many locations?

**Access model**: public, limited, or a mix?

**Naming convention**: how will you organize and identify hotspots?

**Responsibility**: who manages the hotspots day-to-day?

**Monitoring**: how will you track performance and address issues?

A few minutes of planning prevents confusion later.

---

## Infrastructure requirements

Linkr does not require special hardware. If your existing Wi-Fi infrastructure works for your users, it will work for Linkr.

However, consider:

- **Capacity**: can your access points handle additional connections?
- **Bandwidth**: do you have headroom for shared usage?
- **Isolation**: is guest traffic separated from internal networks?
- **Uptime**: are your access points reliably online?

Organizations with well-maintained infrastructure typically have no issues. Organizations with overloaded or unreliable networks should address those issues first.

---

## Sharing hotspots in bulk

For organizations with many hotspots, the process is:

1. Compile a list of locations with connectivity to share
2. Create each hotspot in the Linkr app or through batch tools
3. Configure access settings consistently (or per-location if needed)
4. Activate all hotspots
5. Verify they appear correctly on the map

You can share hotspots one at a time or in batches. The network handles any volume.

---

## Organizing hotspots

Use consistent naming to keep track of your deployments:

- Include location identifiers (building name, floor, area)
- Use prefixes or suffixes to indicate your organization
- Avoid generic names that could be confused with other hotspots

Example naming patterns:

- "CityLibrary-MainFloor"
- "AcmeCorp-Building3-Lobby"
- "Festival2024-Stage1"

Good naming makes management easier as your deployment grows.

---

## Monitoring at scale

With many hotspots, manual monitoring becomes impractical. Focus on:

**Aggregate status**: how many hotspots are online vs offline?

**Reliability trends**: are scores improving or declining?

**Problem hotspots**: which locations have recurring issues?

The Linkr dashboard provides these views. Set aside time to review periodically.

---

## Handling issues

When hotspots go offline or underperform:

1. Identify the affected hotspots
2. Diagnose the cause (network issue, hardware failure, configuration problem)
3. Resolve the issue
4. Verify recovery on the map

For organizations with IT teams, integrate Linkr monitoring into existing processes. Treat hotspot availability like any other infrastructure concern.

---

## Expanding over time

Most organizations start with a limited deployment and expand:

- Share hotspots at flagship locations first
- Learn what works and what causes problems
- Expand to additional locations based on results
- Adjust access settings as you understand usage patterns

There is no pressure to deploy everywhere at once. Incremental expansion is prudent.

## Working with Linkr

For organizations with complex needs or large deployments, Linkr may offer:

- Dedicated support contacts
- Deployment consultation
- Custom integration options

Reach out if you need assistance beyond self-service capabilities.

---

## Measuring success

How do you know if your deployment is working?

- **Uptime**: are your hotspots reliably online?
- **Reliability scores**: are they stable or improving?
- **Usage**: are people connecting?
- **Feedback**: are users reporting positive experiences?

If these indicators are healthy, your deployment is successful. If not, investigate and improve.

<Note>
Organizational deployments are not fundamentally different from individual contributions. They are just more of them. The same principles apply: share reliably, configure thoughtfully, and monitor actively.
