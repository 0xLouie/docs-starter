# Linkr for Organizations

Organizations — businesses, institutions, municipalities, and other entities — can participate in Linkr alongside individual contributors. The network does not distinguish between a single home hotspot and a thousand campus access points. Both are contributions.

---

## Why organizations use Linkr

Organizations have different motivations than individuals, but the mechanics are the same.

**Visibility** — making existing connectivity discoverable to people who need it

**Infrastructure contribution** — participating in shared public infrastructure

**Coverage extension** — filling gaps in areas they serve

**Coordination** — managing connectivity across multiple locations from a single system

Some organizations want to help. Others want their connectivity to be found. Both reasons are valid.

## How organizations participate

Organizations share hotspots the same way individuals do:

1. Create a Linkr account
2. Share hotspots at their locations
3. Configure access settings
4. Monitor availability and performance

The difference is scale. An individual might share one hotspot. An organization might share hundreds.

## Organizational accounts

Linkr accounts are the same for everyone. However, organizations typically:

- Create a dedicated account for hotspot management
- Assign responsibility to specific team members
- Use naming conventions to organize hotspots by location
- Monitor aggregate performance across all hotspots

There is no special "enterprise" tier required to share multiple hotspots.

---

## Access configuration for organizations

Organizations typically use:

**Public** — for truly open connectivity (parks, public buildings, community centers)

**Limited** — for member-only or employee-only access

**Private** — rarely, for specific internal use cases

Most organizational deployments are public or limited. The goal is usually to extend access to a defined population — customers, visitors, residents, or the general public.

## Benefits of organizational participation

For the organization:

- Increased visibility for their locations
- Participation in community infrastructure
- Better data about connectivity usage

For the network:

- More hotspots in more places
- More reliable infrastructure (organizations often have better uptime)
- Coverage in areas individuals might not reach

For users:

- More options for finding connectivity
- Higher-reliability hotspots in commercial and public spaces
- Coverage in areas like campuses, venues, and transit hubs

## Getting started

If your organization is considering Linkr:

1. Identify locations where you have connectivity to share
2. Assess your existing Wi-Fi infrastructure
3. Decide on access configuration (public vs limited)
4. Create an account and begin sharing hotspots
5. Monitor and expand based on results

Start small if you prefer. Share hotspots at a few locations, observe how it works, then expand if it makes sense.

<Note>
Linkr welcomes organizations of any size. A small business with one location and a global enterprise with thousands of sites can both participate on the same terms.
