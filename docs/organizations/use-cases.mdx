title: Organizational Use Cases
description: How different organizations deploy connectivity through Linkr
---

Organizations deploy Linkr in different ways depending on their goals and context. Here are common patterns.

---

## Universities and campuses

Campus environments often have extensive Wi-Fi coverage that is underutilized outside of academic hours.

**How they use Linkr:**

- Share campus-wide connectivity as public or student-only
- Extend coverage to adjacent areas (sidewalks, parking lots, nearby streets)
- Make visitor access easier through discoverable hotspots

**Why it works:**

- Campuses have robust infrastructure
- Students and staff already use the network
- Public access builds community goodwill

---

## Municipalities and public spaces

Cities and towns can make public connectivity visible and accessible through Linkr.

**How they use Linkr:**

- Share connectivity in parks, libraries, community centers
- Coordinate coverage across multiple departments and locations
- Provide discoverable access for residents and visitors

**Why it works:**

- Public spaces should have public infrastructure
- Linkr provides visibility that static signs cannot
- Residents can find connectivity without hunting for passwords

---

## Venues and event spaces

Concert halls, convention centers, stadiums, and other venues can share connectivity during events.

**How they use Linkr:**

- Deploy event-specific hotspots that appear on the map during events
- Provide reliable connectivity for attendees
- Remove or pause hotspots when events end

**Why it works:**

- Events create temporary but intense connectivity demand
- Attendees can discover and access connectivity before arrival
- Venues can track usage and improve coverage over time

## Retail and hospitality

Businesses like cafes, hotels, and shops can make their customer Wi-Fi discoverable beyond their immediate foot traffic.

**How they use Linkr:**

- Share existing customer Wi-Fi as a Linkr hotspot
- Attract visitors who are searching for connectivity
- Provide consistent access without changing passwords constantly

**Why it works:**

- Wi-Fi is already offered; Linkr just makes it discoverable
- Nearby users searching for connectivity may discover the business
- No additional infrastructure required

---

## Corporate campuses

Large employers with distributed offices can coordinate connectivity across locations.

**How they use Linkr:**

- Share guest network access at all office locations
- Use limited access for employee-only connectivity
- Provide consistent experience across locations worldwide

**Why it works:**

- Employees traveling between offices can find connectivity easily
- Visitors can access guest networks without IT involvement
- Global visibility from a single management point

---

## Transit and transportation

Airports, train stations, bus terminals, and other transit hubs can provide discoverable connectivity.

**How they use Linkr:**

- Share connectivity throughout terminals and waiting areas
- Provide coverage that travelers can discover before arrival
- Coordinate with multiple vendors and operators

**Why it works:**

- Travelers desperately need connectivity
- Pre-arrival discovery reduces frustration
- High-traffic locations justify robust infrastructure

---

## Developing regions and rural areas

Organizations working in underserved areas can use Linkr to extend connectivity visibility.

**How they use Linkr:**

- Share hotspots at community facilities
- Create discoverable coverage in areas with limited options
- Build local knowledge of where connectivity exists

**Why it works:**

- Even one hotspot in an underserved area is valuable
- Visibility helps people plan around available connectivity
- Community contributions compound over time

---

## Common patterns

Across use cases, successful organizational deployments share characteristics:

- **Clear purpose**: understanding why they are sharing
- **Appropriate access**: matching configuration to their audience
- **Reliable infrastructure**: maintaining high uptime
- **Active monitoring**: tracking performance and addressing issues

<Note>
Your organization's use case may not match these exactly. The system is flexible. If you have connectivity and a reason to share it, Linkr can accommodate your model.
