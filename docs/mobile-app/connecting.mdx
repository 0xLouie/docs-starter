# Connecting to Hotspots

Finding a hotspot is only the first step. The app also helps you connect and manage your sessions.

---

## Finding a hotspot to connect to

From the map:

1. Browse or search for hotspots in your area
2. Look for green markers (online and available)
3. Tap a marker to see details
4. Check the access type. Public hotspots are accessible to everyone.

From the Nearby list:

1. Swipe up from the bottom of the map
2. Browse hotspots sorted by distance
3. Status and reliability are shown at a glance
4. Tap to see details and connect

---

## Connecting

Once you have found a suitable hotspot:

1. Tap **Connect** on the hotspot detail view
2. The app verifies the hotspot is available
3. If accessible, connection instructions appear
4. Follow the instructions to join the network

For most hotspots, this means:

- Your device's Wi-Fi settings open
- You select the hotspot's network
- You enter the password (if required)
- You are connected

The exact process depends on how the contributor configured their hotspot.

## Connection status

While connected, the app shows:

- **Connected indicator**: confirms you are on a Linkr hotspot
- **Hotspot name**: which hotspot you are using
- **Session duration**: how long you have been connected
- **Signal quality**: general indication of connection strength

This information appears in the app and optionally as a notification.

---

## Managing your session

While connected:

**Stay connected**: continue using the internet normally

**Check status**: open the app to see session details

**Disconnect**: tap **Disconnect** when you are done

Disconnecting is optional. You can also simply leave the hotspot's range or switch to another network.

---

## Connection history

The app tracks your connection history in the **Connections** section:

- Which hotspots you have connected to
- When you connected
- How long each session lasted

This helps you:

- Find hotspots you have used before
- Identify reliable options you trust
- Track your usage over time

## Troubleshooting connections

If you cannot connect:

**Hotspot shows offline**
- The hotspot may have gone down since the map updated
- Wait and try again, or find an alternative

**Access denied**
- The hotspot may be limited or private
- Check the access type. You may not meet the criteria.

**Cannot find the network**
- Move closer to the hotspot's location
- The wireless network may have a different name than the Linkr listing
- The hotspot may be temporarily unavailable

**Connected but no internet**
- The hotspot's upstream connection may have issues
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Report the issue so others are aware

---

## Reporting issues

If a hotspot does not work as expected:

1. Go to the hotspot detail view
2. Tap **Report Issue**
3. Select the type of problem:
   - Cannot connect
   - No internet access
   - Poor performance
   - Incorrect location
   - Other
4. Add details if helpful
5. Submit

Reports help improve the network. Hotspots with repeated issues may be flagged or investigated.

## Data usage

When connected to a Linkr hotspot, your data usage passes through that hotspot's internet connection.

- Your cellular data is not used (unless you disconnect)
- Usage counts against the hotspot contributor's connection
- Be respectful and avoid excessive bandwidth consumption

<Note>
Connection is the payoff for discovery. The map shows you where connectivity exists; connection lets you actually use it.
