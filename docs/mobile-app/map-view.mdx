description: Exploring and navigating the connectivity map
---

The map is the heart of the Linkr app. It shows every shared hotspot on the network, updated in real time.

---

## Opening the map

The map is the default view when you open the app. If you are elsewhere in the app, tap the **Map** icon in the navigation bar to return.

---

## What you see

The map displays:

- **Hotspot markers**: each marker represents a shared hotspot
- **Your location**: a blue dot showing where you are (if location services are enabled)
- **Coverage indicators**: visual cues showing hotspot density in different areas

Markers are color-coded by status:

- **Green**: online and available
- **Gray**: offline or unavailable
- **Blue**: your own hotspots

---

## Navigating the map

**Pan**: drag with one finger to move around the map

**Zoom**: pinch with two fingers to zoom in or out

**Center on location**: tap the location button to return to your current position

**Search**: tap the search bar to jump to a specific address or place

The map loads hotspots dynamically as you navigate. Zoom out to see regional coverage; zoom in to see individual hotspots.

---

## Viewing hotspot details

Tap any marker to see hotspot details:

- **Name**: the hotspot's display name
- **Status**: online or offline
- **Reliability score**: based on historical availability
- **Access type**: public, limited, or private
- **Distance**: how far you are from the hotspot

From the detail view, you can:

- **Connect**: if the hotspot is accessible to you
- **Get directions**: open in your maps app
- **Report an issue**: flag problems with the hotspot

---

## Filtering hotspots

Tap the filter icon to narrow what you see:

**By status**
- Show only online hotspots
- Show only offline hotspots
- Show all

**By access type**
- Public only
- Include limited
- Include private

**By reliability**
- High reliability only
- All reliability levels

Filters help you focus on hotspots you can actually use right now.

---

## Finding hotspots near you

If location services are enabled, the app automatically shows hotspots near your current position.

The **Nearby** list (swipe up from the bottom of the map) shows hotspots sorted by distance, with status and reliability at a glance.

This is the fastest way to find usable connectivity when you need it.

---

## Searching for locations

To explore a different area:

1. Tap the search bar at the top of the map
2. Type an address, city, or landmark
3. Select from the suggestions
4. The map jumps to that location

Use search to plan ahead. Check connectivity at your destination before you travel.

---

## Map layers

The map uses a clean, minimal style designed for readability. Hotspot markers are prominent; background details are subdued.

The map works in both light and dark mode, matching your device settings.

<Note>
The map shows contributed hotspots, not estimated coverage. If an area appears empty, it means no one has shared a hotspot there yet, not that connectivity is impossible.
