title: Managing Your Hotspots
description: Monitoring and maintaining your shared connectivity
---

Once you have created hotspots, the app helps you monitor their performance and manage them over time.

---

## The My Hotspots view

Tap **My Hotspots** in the app to see all hotspots you have shared. For each hotspot, you see:

- **Name**: what you called it
- **Status**: online or offline, updated in real time
- **Reliability score**: percentage based on historical availability
- **Access type**: public, limited, or private
- **Location**: address or coordinates

Tap any hotspot to see detailed information and management options.

---

## Hotspot details

The detail view shows:

**Status section**
- Current status (online/offline)
- Last time the hotspot was checked
- Uptime for the current session

**Performance section**
- Reliability score (30-day average)
- Uptime history graph
- Total time online

**Activity section**
- Number of connections
- Recent connection events
- Usage trends

This data helps you understand how your hotspot is performing and where you might improve.

---

## Editing a hotspot

To change a hotspot's settings:

1. Go to **My Hotspots**
2. Tap the hotspot
3. Tap **Edit**
4. Modify the settings you want to change:
   - Name
   - Location (for fixed hotspots)
   - Access configuration
5. Tap **Save**

Changes take effect immediately on the map.

---

## Pausing a hotspot

If you need to temporarily stop sharing:

1. Go to the hotspot's detail view
2. Tap **Pause Hotspot**
3. Confirm

When paused:

- The hotspot disappears from the public map
- Availability tracking is suspended
- Your reliability score is not affected by downtime while paused
- All settings are preserved

To resume, tap **Resume Hotspot**. The hotspot reappears on the map and tracking resumes.

Use pause for planned downtime: maintenance, travel, or temporary situations.

---

## Deleting a hotspot

To permanently remove a hotspot:

1. Go to the hotspot's detail view
2. Tap **Delete Hotspot**
3. Confirm the deletion

Deletion is permanent. The hotspot is removed from the map, and all historical data is deleted.

If you might want to share from this location again, consider pausing instead.

---

## Monitoring availability

Your hotspot's reliability score depends on consistent availability. The app helps you monitor this:

**Status indicator**: see at a glance if your hotspot is online

**Uptime graph**: visualize availability over the past 30 days

**Alerts**: receive notifications when your hotspot goes offline (if enabled)

If your reliability score is lower than expected, check:

- Is your internet connection stable?
- Is your router/device powered on?
- Is your wireless network enabled and broadcasting?

---

## Notifications

Configure notifications in **Account** → **Notifications**:

- **Offline alerts**: get notified when a hotspot goes offline
- **Back online alerts**: get notified when it recovers
- **Weekly summary**: receive a digest of your hotspots' performance

Notifications help you respond quickly to issues and maintain high reliability.

## Viewing your hotspots on the map

Your hotspots appear on the main map with a distinct marker (blue instead of green). This helps you:

- See where your contributions fit in the larger network
- Verify that locations are accurate
- Spot clusters or gaps in your coverage

Tap your own marker to access management options directly from the map.

<Note>
Consistent monitoring leads to consistent availability. Check your hotspots regularly, respond to offline alerts promptly, and your reliability scores will reflect it.
