# Creating Hotspots

The Linkr app makes it easy to share your connectivity. In a few taps, your hotspot becomes part of the global network.

---

## Before you start

To create a hotspot, you need:

- A Linkr account (signed in)
- An active internet connection to share
- A way to create a wireless access point (your phone's hotspot feature, a router you control, etc.)

---

## Creating a hotspot

1. Open the app and tap the **+** button (or go to **My Hotspots** → **Add Hotspot**)

2. **Choose your hotspot type**
   - **Mobile hotspot**: share your phone's cellular connection
   - **Fixed hotspot**: share a router or access point at a specific location

3. **Set the location**
   - For mobile hotspots: uses your current location (updates as you move)
   - For fixed hotspots: confirm or adjust the pin on the map

4. **Name your hotspot**
   - Choose a recognizable name (e.g., "Downtown Cafe", "Home Office")
   - This name appears on the map for other users

5. **Configure access**
   - **Public**: anyone can connect
   - **Limited**: only users meeting criteria you set
   - **Private**: only users you approve individually

6. **Review and confirm**
   - Check the details
   - Tap **Create Hotspot**

Your hotspot is now live on the network.

## Mobile vs fixed hotspots

**Mobile hotspots** use your phone's built-in hotspot feature to share cellular data. They:

- Move with you
- Update location automatically
- May have variable reliability (depends on cellular signal)
- Use your data plan

**Fixed hotspots** are tied to a specific location, like your home router. They:

- Stay in one place
- Provide consistent coverage
- Typically have higher reliability
- Use your existing internet connection

Choose the type that matches what you are sharing.

## Configuring your access point

After creating the hotspot in Linkr, you need to enable the actual wireless network:

**For mobile hotspots:**
1. Go to your phone's Settings
2. Enable Personal Hotspot
3. Note the network name and password
4. Share these with users who need them (or configure Linkr to handle authentication)

**For fixed hotspots:**
1. Log into your router's admin panel
2. Enable a guest network (recommended) or use your existing network
3. Configure the network name and password
4. Ensure the network is broadcasting

Linkr registers your hotspot on the map; you are responsible for the actual wireless network.

---

## Location accuracy

For fixed hotspots, accurate location matters. Users will navigate to where the map shows your hotspot.

When setting the location:

- Use GPS for automatic placement
- Drag the pin to adjust if GPS is off
- Zoom in to place precisely
- Consider where users will actually connect from

A hotspot placed in the wrong location frustrates users and reduces your reliability score.

---

## After creation

Once your hotspot is created:

- It appears on the global map immediately
- Linkr begins tracking its availability
- Other users can discover and connect to it
- You can monitor it in **My Hotspots**

See [Managing Your Hotspots](/docs/mobile-app/managing-hotspots) for ongoing management.

## Creating multiple hotspots

You can create as many hotspots as you want. Each one:

- Has its own name, location, and settings
- Is tracked independently
- Appears separately on the map

If you manage connectivity at multiple locations (home, office, family members' places), create a hotspot for each.

<Note>
Creating a hotspot takes about 30 seconds. The impact (adding to global connectivity infrastructure) lasts as long as you keep it online.
