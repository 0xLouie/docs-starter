# Why Observability Matters

Linkr treats observability as a core principle. The network does not assume connectivity exists. It observes and verifies.

---

## What observability means

Observability is the ability to understand the state of a system by looking at its outputs.

For Linkr, this means:

- Hotspots are not assumed to be online. They are checked.
- Reliability is not claimed. It is measured.
- Availability is not promised. It is tracked.

Everything you see on the map is based on real data, not assertions.

---

## Why this matters for connectivity

Traditional connectivity information is full of assumptions:

- Coverage maps show where signals *should* reach based on tower locations and terrain models
- Venue listings claim Wi-Fi is available without verifying it works
- Directories list networks that may or may not still exist

These assumptions are often wrong. A coverage map might show strong signal where there is none. A cafe might advertise Wi-Fi that has been broken for months.

Users cannot tell the difference until they try. And by then, it is too late.

## The Linkr approach

Linkr replaces assumptions with observations.

**Status is live.** Each hotspot's current availability is determined by active checks, not by historical data or contributor claims.

**Reliability is measured.** Scores are calculated from observed uptime over time, not from specifications or promises.

**The map reflects reality.** What you see is what has been verified, not what might theoretically exist.

---

## How observation works

Linkr continuously monitors shared hotspots:

1. The network checks whether each hotspot is reachable
2. Check results are recorded
3. Data is aggregated to calculate status and reliability
4. The map is updated

This happens automatically and continuously. Contributors do not need to report their status. It is observed.

## Benefits of observability

**Trust.** Users can rely on the map because it reflects verified data.

**Accountability.** Contributors see how their hotspots actually perform, not how they think they perform.

**Improvement.** Problems surface quickly, enabling faster fixes.

**Honesty.** No one can claim reliability they do not have.

## The limits of observability

Observability is not omniscience. Linkr can observe:

- Whether a hotspot responds to checks
- How often it has been available over time
- General availability patterns

Linkr cannot observe:

- Quality of experience for a specific user at a specific moment
- Root cause of outages
- Future availability

The map tells you what has been observed. Using that information wisely is up to you.

## Observability as infrastructure

Infrastructure requires observability. You cannot rely on what you cannot see.

- Power grids monitor voltage and frequency
- Roads have traffic sensors and condition reports
- Buildings have fire alarms and occupancy sensors

Connectivity has historically lacked this. You could not see whether a network was online until you tried to connect.

Linkr adds the missing observability layer. The map is not just discovery. It is monitoring, made visible to everyone.

<Note>
Observability is not about being skeptical of contributors. It is about providing everyone, contributors and users alike, with accurate information. Better data leads to better decisions.
