title: Community-Powered Infrastructure
description: Why Linkr is built by its participants
---

Linkr is not a service provided by a company. It is infrastructure built by the people who use it.

---

## What community-powered means

The network consists entirely of contributions from participants. Every hotspot on the map was shared by someone: an individual, a business, an organization.

Linkr provides the coordination layer:

- Registration and discovery
- Availability tracking
- Access management
- The map interface

The actual connectivity comes from the community.

---

## Why this model

Traditional connectivity infrastructure is built and owned by large entities: telecom companies, ISPs, government agencies. These entities decide where coverage exists, how it is accessed, and at what cost.

This model has limits:

- Incentives favor dense, profitable areas
- Coverage decisions are centralized
- Users have no way to participate

A community-powered model inverts this:

- Anyone can contribute
- Coverage emerges from participation
- The network reflects actual demand

---

## The result

When infrastructure is community-powered:

**It reflects reality.** Hotspots exist where people put them, which is where they have connectivity to share. This tends to correlate with where people are.

**It adapts organically.** As neighborhoods change, populations shift, and demand evolves, the network can evolve with them. No central planning required.

**It includes everyone.** There is no application process, no franchise agreement, no minimum investment. If you can share a hotspot, you can participate.

---

## Trade-offs

Community-powered infrastructure has different trade-offs than centralized infrastructure.

**Coverage is uneven.** Some areas have many contributors; others have none. There is no guarantee of coverage anywhere.

**Quality varies.** Some hotspots are highly reliable; others are not. The network reflects what participants provide.

**Coordination is decentralized.** There is no single entity ensuring coverage or quality standards. The system relies on observability and user behavior to surface what works.

These trade-offs are acceptable because the alternative (waiting for centralized providers to solve connectivity everywhere) is not working.

---

## The role of participants

Participants are not customers. They are builders.

When you share a hotspot, you are not subscribing to a service. You are contributing to infrastructure that others can use.

When you connect to a hotspot, you are using infrastructure that someone else built.

This creates a different relationship. The network exists because of collective action, not because of a transaction.

---

## Sustainability

For community-powered infrastructure to persist, participation must be sustainable.

This means:

- Contributing should be simple, not burdensome
- The value of contributing should be clear
- The system should not depend on any single participant

Linkr is designed for this. Sharing a hotspot is low-friction. The map provides visibility for contributions. No single hotspot is critical. The network is resilient to individual changes.

<Note>
Community-powered does not mean amateur or unreliable. It means participant-driven. Some of the most robust infrastructure on the internet, from open-source software to public transit, is community-powered. Linkr applies this model to connectivity.
