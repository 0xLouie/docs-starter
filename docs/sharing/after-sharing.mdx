description: What happens once your hotspot is part of the network

# After You Share

Once you share a hotspot, it becomes part of the Linkr network. Here is what happens next.

---

## Your hotspot goes live

Immediately after sharing:

- Your hotspot appears on the global map
- Linkr begins monitoring its availability
- Users can discover it

There is no review period or manual approval. Your hotspot is live as soon as you activate it.

---

## Availability tracking begins

Linkr continuously checks whether your hotspot is online. These checks happen automatically and do not require any action from you.

Over time, this creates a record of your hotspot's availability. The data is used to:

- Calculate your reliability score
- Show users whether you are currently online
- Help users assess your hotspot before connecting

The more consistently your hotspot is available, the better your reliability score becomes.

---

## Users discover and connect

If your hotspot is public or the user meets your access criteria, they can connect. When this happens:

- The connection is established through Linkr
- The user accesses the internet through your hotspot
- Connection data is recorded (for availability tracking, not content inspection)

You may see connection activity in your dashboard. This helps you understand how your hotspot is being used.

---

## Monitoring your hotspot

The Linkr app provides a dashboard where you can:

- See your hotspot's current status
- View historical availability
- Check your reliability score
- Review connection activity

This information helps you understand how your hotspot is performing and whether any issues need attention.

---

## Handling issues

If your hotspot goes offline:

- Its status changes to offline on the map
- Your reliability score is affected (proportional to downtime)
- Users cannot connect until it is back online

Common causes of downtime:

- Internet connection issues
- Power outages
- Router restarts
- Intentional pausing

If downtime is planned, you can pause your hotspot to avoid affecting your reliability score.

---

## Growing your contribution

After your first hotspot, you might consider:

- Sharing additional hotspots in other locations
- Improving your existing hotspot's reliability
- Upgrading hardware for better performance
- Adjusting access settings based on usage patterns

There is no pressure to expand. A single reliable hotspot is valuable. Multiple reliable hotspots are more valuable.

---

## The long-term view

Your hotspot is infrastructure. The longer it remains available, the more trust it builds, the more users rely on it, and the more it contributes to the network.

Some hotspots are shared for a day. Others remain online for years. Both are valid contributions. But the network is most useful when hotspots persist.

<Note>
Sharing a hotspot is a commitment, but it is not a contract. You can adjust, pause, or remove your hotspot whenever you need to. The goal is sustainable contribution, not obligation.
