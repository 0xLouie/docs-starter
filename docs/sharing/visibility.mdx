# Visibility and Reliability

When you share a hotspot, other users see it on the map. How it appears, and how useful it seems, depends on its visibility and reliability.

---

## How hotspots appear on the map

Each shared hotspot shows:

- **Location marker**: where it is
- **Status indicator**: online or offline
- **Reliability score**: based on historical availability
- **Access type**: public, limited, or private

Users make decisions based on this information. A hotspot that is online, highly reliable, and public will attract more interest than one that is offline, unreliable, or private.

## The reliability score

Linkr tracks your hotspot's availability over time. This creates a reliability score that reflects how consistently your hotspot has been online.

The score is based on:

- **Uptime percentage**: how often the hotspot is online when checked
- **Consistency**: whether availability is stable or erratic
- **Duration**: longer track records carry more weight

A hotspot that has been online 99% of the time for three months will have a higher reliability score than one that has been online 99% of the time for three days.

## Why reliability matters

For users, reliability is the difference between "this might work" and "this will work."

A hotspot with a high reliability score signals:

- The contributor takes availability seriously
- The hotspot is likely to be online when needed
- Past users have been able to connect successfully

Users traveling to unfamiliar places depend on reliability scores to make decisions before arrival.

## Improving your reliability score

Your reliability score improves when your hotspot:

- Remains online consistently
- Avoids unexpected outages
- Maintains availability over extended periods

There is no shortcut. Reliability is earned through consistent availability.

If your hotspot goes offline frequently due to power issues, network problems, or being turned off, your reliability score will reflect that.

## Visibility in search results

When users search for hotspots, results are influenced by:

- Proximity to the search location
- Current availability status
- Reliability score
- Access configuration

Highly reliable, currently online, public hotspots tend to appear more prominently. This is not a ranking algorithm. It is practical filtering to help users find usable connectivity.

## International visibility

Your hotspot is visible globally. A user in another country can see your hotspot on the map if they navigate to your area.

This means:

- Travelers can discover your hotspot before they arrive
- Your contribution is part of a worldwide network
- You are helping build global infrastructure, not just local coverage

<Note>
Visibility is automatic. You do not need to do anything special to be discovered. Share your hotspot, keep it online, and users will find it.
