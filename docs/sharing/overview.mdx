title: Sharing a Hotspot
description: What it means to contribute connectivity to Linkr
---

Sharing a hotspot is how you contribute to the Linkr network. When you share, you make your connectivity discoverable and potentially accessible to others.

---

## What sharing means

When you share a hotspot through Linkr:

1. Your hotspot is registered with the network
2. Its location is recorded
3. It becomes visible on the global map
4. Its availability begins being tracked
5. Other users can discover it

Sharing does not automatically give everyone access. You control who can connect through your access settings.

## What you can share

Almost any wireless access point can become a Linkr hotspot:

- **Home router**: share your guest network while keeping your main network private
- **Mobile hotspot**: share your phone's cellular connection
- **Business Wi-Fi**: make your venue's connectivity discoverable
- **Dedicated hardware**: deploy access points specifically for Linkr

The requirement is simple: if it provides wireless internet access and you control it, you can share it.

## Why share

People share hotspots for different reasons:

- To help others find connectivity
- To participate in building shared infrastructure
- To make their existing network more useful
- To extend coverage in underserved areas

Whatever your reason, sharing adds value to the network. Each hotspot makes the map more complete.

## The sharing process

Sharing a hotspot takes a few minutes:

1. Open the Linkr app
2. Select **Share Hotspot**
3. Choose your hotspot type
4. Set your access configuration
5. Confirm the location
6. Activate

Once activated, your hotspot appears on the map. Linkr begins tracking its availability immediately.

## Your responsibilities

When you share a hotspot, you are responsible for:

- Maintaining its availability (keeping it online)
- Honoring your access configuration
- Ensuring the connection you share is legitimate

You are not responsible for what users do with the connectivity, but you should share responsibly and be aware of your network's terms of service.

## Pausing and removing hotspots

You can pause or remove your hotspot at any time:

- **Pausing**: temporarily hides your hotspot from the map while preserving its configuration
- **Removing**: permanently deletes the hotspot from the network

Your hotspots are yours. You are never locked into sharing them.

<Note>
Sharing is voluntary and reversible. You can start with one hotspot, see how it works, and expand from there.
