# How Linkr Works

Linkr operates as a simple loop: contribute, observe, discover, access.

## The system at a glance

## Contribute

Anyone can share a hotspot through the Linkr app. This registers the hotspot with the network and makes it potentially discoverable by others.

Sharing a hotspot does not require special hardware. If you have internet access and a way to create a wireless access point, you can contribute.

---

## Observe

Once a hotspot is shared, Linkr begins tracking its availability. The network observes:

- Whether the hotspot is online
- How consistently it remains available
- General performance characteristics

This observation is continuous. The data is real, not estimated.

---

## Discover

Shared hotspots appear on the Linkr map. Users can browse the map to find connectivity near them or in places they plan to visit.

The map shows:

- Hotspot locations
- Current availability status
- Reliability indicators based on historical data

---

## Access

When a user finds a suitable hotspot, they can connect through Linkr. The access model depends on how the contributor configured their hotspot: public, limited, or private.

If access is granted, the user connects. The connection is tracked, and availability data continues to update.

---

## The feedback loop

Every connection provides data back to the network. This data improves the accuracy of availability tracking and helps surface the most reliable hotspots.

Contributors see how their hotspots are performing. Users see which hotspots are worth using. The network gets better as more people participate.

<Note>
Linkr is not a passive directory. It is a live system where contributions create observable, accessible infrastructure.
