title: The Live Connectivity Map
description: Real-time visibility into the world's connectivity
---

The Linkr map is a real-time view of contributed connectivity worldwide. It is the primary interface for discovering and assessing hotspots.

---

## What the map shows

The map displays every hotspot that has been shared with the Linkr network. Each hotspot appears as a marker with associated metadata:

- **Location**: the physical position of the hotspot
- **Status indicator**: whether the hotspot is currently online
- **Reliability indicator**: based on historical availability
- **Access type**: public, limited, or private

As you pan and zoom, the map loads hotspots in the visible area. There is no artificial limit on what you can see.

## Real-time updates

The map is not a static snapshot. It updates continuously based on live data from the network.

If a hotspot goes offline, its status changes on the map. If a new hotspot is shared, it appears. If availability patterns shift, reliability indicators update.

This means the map reflects reality, not outdated records.

## Map vs. coverage map

Traditional coverage maps show estimated signal strength across geographic areas. They are based on models and assumptions.

The Linkr map shows actual hotspots contributed by actual people. Each marker represents a real access point, not a prediction.

| Coverage map | Linkr map |
|--------------|-----------|
| Estimated coverage | Real hotspots |
| Static data | Live updates |
| Model-based | Observation-based |
| Provider-published | Community-contributed |

## Using the map

**Browse**: pan and zoom to explore connectivity in any area

**Search**: jump to a specific location by address or coordinates

**Filter**: narrow results by status, reliability, or access type

**Select**: tap a hotspot to see details and access options

The map is available in the Linkr app and on the web.

## Map accuracy

The map is only as accurate as the contributions it contains.

If an area has no hotspots shared, the map will show nothing there, even if connectivity exists. This is by design. Linkr only displays what has been contributed and verified, not what might exist.

Over time, as more people contribute, the map becomes more complete. But it will always reflect real contributions, not assumptions.

<Note>
The Linkr map is not a goal. It is a consequence. The map exists because people share hotspots. The more people share, the more useful the map becomes.
