# Hotspots

A hotspot is a wireless access point that has been shared with the Linkr network. It is the fundamental unit of connectivity on Linkr.

---

## What qualifies as a hotspot

Any wireless access point can become a Linkr hotspot:

- A home router with guest network enabled
- A mobile phone sharing its cellular connection
- A dedicated access point at a business
- An outdoor installation in a public space
- A portable device carried by a traveler

The only requirement is that it can provide wireless internet access and be registered through the Linkr app.

## What makes a hotspot useful

Not all hotspots are equally valuable. The most useful hotspots share a few characteristics:

**Availability.** They are online when people need them. A hotspot that is only available sporadically is less useful than one that maintains consistent uptime.

**Reliability.** They provide stable connections. Frequent disconnections or poor performance reduce a hotspot's value.

**Accessibility.** They are configured to allow connections. A hotspot that exists but cannot be accessed serves no purpose on the network.

## How hotspots are identified

Each hotspot on Linkr has:

- A **location**: where it physically exists
- A **status**: whether it is currently online
- A **reliability score**: based on historical availability data
- An **access configuration**: who can connect and under what terms

This information is visible on the map and updated continuously.

## Hotspot lifecycle

A typical hotspot lifecycle:

1. **Registration**: the contributor shares the hotspot through the Linkr app
2. **Verification**: the network confirms the hotspot's location and connectivity
3. **Observation**: availability and performance are tracked over time
4. **Discovery**: the hotspot appears on the map for other users
5. **Access**: users connect, generating usage data
6. **Maintenance**: the contributor monitors and maintains the hotspot

Hotspots can be updated, paused, or removed at any time by the contributor.

## Why hotspots matter

Every hotspot on Linkr represents a real commitment by a real participant. It is not a data point scraped from another source or a marker placed based on assumptions.

When you see a hotspot on the Linkr map, you know:

- Someone chose to share it
- It has been observed by the network
- Its availability data is based on real measurements

This is what distinguishes Linkr from coverage maps and Wi-Fi finders.

<Note>
A single hotspot might seem small. But thousands of hotspots, contributed by thousands of participants, create infrastructure that did not exist before.
