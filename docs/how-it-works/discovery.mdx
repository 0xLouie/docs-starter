# Global Discovery

Every hotspot shared through Linkr becomes globally discoverable. This is the core function of the network: making local connectivity visible worldwide.

## How discovery works

When a contributor shares a hotspot, it is registered with the Linkr network. The hotspot's location, status, and configuration are recorded.

This information is then made available to all Linkr users through the map. Anyone, anywhere, can browse the map and see what connectivity exists in a given area.

Discovery is:

- **Global**: hotspots from any location appear on the same map
- **Real-time**: availability status updates continuously
- **Contextual**: users can filter and search based on their needs

---

## What is discoverable

For each hotspot, users can see:

- **Location**: where the hotspot is physically located
- **Status**: whether it is currently online or offline
- **Reliability**: how consistently it has been available over time
- **Access type**: whether it is public, limited, or private

This gives users enough information to decide whether a hotspot is worth trying before they commit to using it.

## Discovery before arrival

One of the most valuable aspects of Linkr is pre-arrival discovery.

Before traveling to an unfamiliar location, users can check the map to see what connectivity exists there. This allows them to:

- Plan which hotspots to use
- Assess reliability before arrival
- Identify backup options
- Avoid areas with no coverage

This is not possible with traditional connectivity. You cannot know what Wi-Fi networks exist in a place until you are physically there, scanning for them.

## Discovery at location

When users are at a location, Linkr shows nearby hotspots sorted by proximity, availability, and reliability.

This is more useful than a standard Wi-Fi scan because:

- Users can see reliability data, not just network names
- Users can filter for hotspots they can actually access
- Users can see hotspots that might not be immediately visible to a Wi-Fi scan (e.g., slightly out of range but worth walking to)

## The scope of discovery

Discovery on Linkr is not limited to a single city, region, or country. The network is global.

A hotspot shared in Tokyo is discoverable by a user in Berlin. A hotspot shared in a rural village is just as visible as one in a major city.

This creates a single, unified view of community-contributed connectivity worldwide.

<Note>
Discovery is the bridge between local contributions and global access. Without discovery, shared hotspots would be invisible. With discovery, they become infrastructure.
