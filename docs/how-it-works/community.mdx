description: How the network grows through participation

# Community Contributions

Linkr is built by its participants. The network exists because people choose to contribute to it.

---

## What it means to contribute

Contributing to Linkr means sharing a hotspot that others can discover and potentially access.

This is not a passive act. When you contribute a hotspot:

- You are adding real infrastructure to the network
- Your hotspot's availability is tracked and displayed
- Others may rely on your contribution for connectivity

Contributors are the foundation of Linkr. Without them, there is no network.

## Who contributes

**Individuals** — people sharing connectivity from their homes, offices, or mobile devices. This might be a spare router, a guest network, or a phone's hotspot feature.

**Small businesses** — cafes, shops, co-working spaces, and other venues that already offer Wi-Fi to customers. Registering with Linkr makes their connectivity discoverable beyond their immediate foot traffic.

**Organizations** — companies, universities, municipalities, and other entities that deploy connectivity at scale. They contribute dozens or hundreds of hotspots across their facilities.

**Travelers** — people who share mobile hotspots while on the move, creating temporary but valuable connectivity in places that might otherwise have none.

## Why people contribute

Motivations vary:

- To help others find connectivity
- To participate in building shared infrastructure
- To make their existing connectivity more useful
- To be part of a network that benefits from their participation

Some contributors share a single hotspot. Others manage large deployments. Both are valuable.

## Contribution and quality

Not all contributions are equal in impact. The most valuable contributions are:

- **Consistent** — available reliably over time
- **Accessible** — configured to allow connections
- **Well-placed** — located where connectivity is needed

A hotspot that is online 95% of the time in a high-traffic area contributes more to the network than one that is sporadic and isolated.

Linkr surfaces this through reliability indicators, helping users find the best connectivity and helping contributors understand how their hotspots perform.

## The network effect

Each contribution makes the network more valuable:

- More hotspots means more coverage
- More coverage attracts more users
- More users generate more data about what works
- Better data helps contributors improve their hotspots

This is a compounding cycle. The network gets better as it grows, and it grows because it gets better.

<Note>
You do not need permission to contribute. If you have connectivity to share, you can add it to the network. The value of your contribution is determined by its reliability and accessibility, not by any central authority.
