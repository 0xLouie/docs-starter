# The Linkr Map

The Linkr map is the primary interface for discovering connectivity. It shows every hotspot that has been shared with the network, updated in real time.

---

## What the map represents

The map is not a coverage estimate. It is not a prediction of where connectivity might exist.

It is a live view of actual hotspots, shared by real contributors, with real availability data.

Every marker on the map represents:

- A specific physical location
- A hotspot that someone chose to share
- Availability data based on continuous observation

If a location has no markers, it means no one has shared a hotspot there — not that connectivity does not exist.

---

## Map structure

The map displays hotspots as markers. Each marker includes:

- **Position** — the geographic location of the hotspot
- **Status** — current availability (online/offline)
- **Reliability** — historical availability score
- **Access type** — public, limited, or private

You can interact with the map by panning, zooming, and tapping markers for details.

---

## Accessing the map

The map is available through:

- **Mobile app** — the primary experience, with GPS integration
- **Web app** — accessible from any browser at linkrmap.com

Both views show the same data. The mobile app offers additional features like proximity-based discovery and connection management.

---

## Map updates

The map updates continuously. When:

- A new hotspot is shared → it appears on the map
- A hotspot goes offline → its status updates
- A hotspot is removed → it disappears from the map
- Reliability data changes → indicators update

There is no manual refresh required. The map reflects the current state of the network.

---

## Geographic scope

The map is global. Every shared hotspot, anywhere in the world, appears on the same map.

This means:

- You can explore connectivity in any country
- You can plan trips by checking coverage at your destination
- You can see how the network is distributed worldwide

There are no regional restrictions or separate maps for different areas.

---

## Limitations

The map shows what has been contributed, not what exists.

If an area has Wi-Fi networks but no one has shared them through Linkr, the map will be empty there. The map cannot show what it does not know about.

This is a feature, not a bug. Linkr shows verified, contributed infrastructure — not estimates or scrapes from other sources.

<Note>
The map is the face of the network. It is only as complete as the contributions it contains. Every hotspot you share makes the map more useful.
