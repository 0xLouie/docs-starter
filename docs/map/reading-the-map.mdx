# Reading the Map

Each hotspot on the map displays information to help you assess it before connecting. Here is how to read that information.

---

## Status indicators

Every hotspot shows its current availability status:

**Online** — the hotspot is currently reachable and available for connections

**Offline** — the hotspot is not responding; connections are not possible

Status is determined through continuous availability checks. If a hotspot stops responding, its status changes to offline within minutes.

---

## Reliability indicators

Reliability reflects how consistently a hotspot has been available over time.

Linkr displays reliability as a score or tier:

- **High reliability** — online 95%+ of the time over an extended period
- **Moderate reliability** — online 80-95% of the time
- **Low reliability** — online less than 80% of the time

A new hotspot will not have a reliability score until enough data has been collected. These hotspots are marked accordingly.

---

## Why reliability matters

Status tells you whether a hotspot is online *now*. Reliability tells you whether it is *usually* online.

For planning:

- If you need connectivity tomorrow, check reliability to gauge likelihood
- If you need connectivity now, check status to see current availability

A hotspot that is online now but has low reliability might go offline soon. A hotspot that is offline now but has high reliability might come back soon.

## Access indicators

Hotspots display their access configuration:

**Public** — any Linkr user can connect

**Limited** — only users meeting specific criteria can connect

**Private** — only individually approved users can connect

You can see the access type before tapping the hotspot. This helps you filter for hotspots you can actually use.

## Hotspot details

Tapping a hotspot opens its detail view, which includes:

- Name (if provided by the contributor)
- Full address or location description
- Current status with last-checked timestamp
- Reliability score and history
- Access type and any requirements
- Connection button (if accessible)

This gives you complete information to decide whether to connect.

---

## Interpreting sparse areas

If an area of the map has few or no hotspots, it means:

- No one has shared a hotspot there, or
- Shared hotspots in that area are currently offline

It does not mean connectivity is impossible — only that nothing has been contributed to Linkr there yet.

Sparse areas are opportunities. If you have connectivity in an underserved location, sharing it adds significant value.

## Practical reading

When using the map:

1. Start by looking at the area you care about
2. Identify hotspots that are online and accessible to you
3. Check reliability — prefer higher-reliability hotspots when possible
4. Tap to see details and confirm access
5. Connect when ready

<Note>
The map rewards patience. Take time to assess your options rather than connecting to the first hotspot you see. A few extra seconds of research can save frustration later.
