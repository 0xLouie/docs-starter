# Finding Connectivity

The map is not just for browsing. It is a tool for finding and accessing connectivity when you need it.

---

## Discovery methods

### Proximity-based

If you have location services enabled, the map shows hotspots near your current location. This is the fastest way to find connectivity when you are in an unfamiliar place.

The app can sort nearby hotspots by:

- Distance from your location
- Current availability status
- Reliability score
- Access type

### Search-based

If you want to explore a specific area, like a destination you are traveling to, use search:

1. Tap the search bar
2. Enter an address, city, or landmark
3. The map navigates to that location
4. Browse hotspots in the area

This is useful for pre-arrival planning.

### Browse-based

You can pan and zoom the map manually to explore any area. This is helpful when:

- You want to survey connectivity in a region
- You are looking for patterns (e.g., clusters of hotspots)
- You are curious about global coverage

## Filtering hotspots

Not all hotspots are relevant to you. Use filters to narrow results:

**By status**: show only online hotspots, only offline, or all

**By reliability**: show only high-reliability hotspots

**By access**: show only public hotspots (the ones you can definitely connect to)

Filters help you focus on hotspots that are actually usable for your situation.

## Evaluating options

When you have multiple hotspots to choose from:

1. **Check status**: eliminate offline options
2. **Compare reliability**: prefer higher reliability scores
3. **Confirm access**: ensure you can connect (public or you meet limited criteria)
4. **Consider proximity**: closer is usually better for signal strength
5. **Read details**: some hotspots include notes from contributors

There is rarely a perfect option. Choose the best available based on your priorities.

---

## Connecting

Once you have selected a hotspot:

1. Tap the hotspot marker or select from the list
2. Review details one more time
3. Tap **Connect**
4. The app handles the rest

If the connection is successful, you are now using that hotspot's connectivity. The app shows your connection status and can notify you if the connection drops.

## When connectivity is unavailable

Sometimes there are no usable hotspots:

- The area has no contributions
- All hotspots are offline
- All hotspots are private or limited (and you do not have access)

In these cases, your options are:

- Wait and check back later in case a hotspot comes online
- Move to an area with better coverage
- Contribute. If you have connectivity to share, add it to help others in the same situation

---

## Building habits

Regular Linkr users develop habits:

- Check the map before traveling
- Identify backup hotspots in case the primary option fails
- Contribute hotspots in areas they frequently visit
- Report issues to help improve the network

The more you use the map, the better you become at finding reliable connectivity quickly.

<Note>
The map is most useful when you treat it as a planning tool, not just a last-resort lookup. Check coverage before you need it, and you will rarely be stuck without options.
