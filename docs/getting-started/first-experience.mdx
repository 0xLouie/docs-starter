# First-Time Experience

The first time you open Linkr, you will see the map. This is the starting point for everything.

---

## The map view

The map shows contributed hotspots in your area (if any exist) and worldwide. You can:

- Pan and zoom to explore different areas
- Tap hotspots to see their details
- Search for specific locations

If you have granted location permissions, the map centers on your current location. If not, it shows a default view that you can navigate manually.

---

## Discovering your first hotspot

To find a hotspot:

1. Look at the map for markers near you or in an area you are interested in
2. Tap a marker to see hotspot details
3. Review the status (online/offline), reliability score, and access type
4. If the hotspot is accessible to you, tap **Connect**

Not all hotspots will be accessible. Some are configured as private or limited to specific users. The map shows you what exists; access depends on how the contributor configured it.

---

## Connecting to a hotspot

When you connect to a hotspot through Linkr:

1. The app verifies that the hotspot is available
2. If access is granted, your device connects to the hotspot's network
3. You are now using that hotspot's connectivity

The connection process is handled by the app. You do not need to manually select Wi-Fi networks or enter passwords for Linkr hotspots.

---

## Sharing your first hotspot

If you want to contribute:

1. Tap the **Share** or **+** button in the app
2. Select the type of hotspot you want to share
3. Configure access settings (public, limited, or private)
4. Confirm the location
5. Activate the hotspot

Your hotspot is now part of the network. It will appear on the map and begin being tracked for availability.

---

## What to explore

After your first session, consider:

- **Browsing other areas**: check connectivity in places you plan to visit
- **Reviewing hotspot details**: understand what reliability and status indicators mean
- **Contributing**: if you have connectivity to share, add it to the network

Linkr becomes more useful the more you engage with it. The map improves as you discover and contribute.

<Note>
There is no required tutorial or onboarding flow. The app is designed to be immediately usable. Explore at your own pace.
