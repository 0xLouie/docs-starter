## Web app

The web app provides map access and account management from any browser. Visit linkrmap.com to use it.

The web app is useful for:

- Browsing the map on a larger screen

## After installation

Once installed:

1. Open the app
2. Sign in with your account (or create one)
3. Grant location permissions when prompted
4. Begin exploring the map

Location permissions allow the app to show hotspots near you and enable features like proximity-based discovery. You can use the map without location permissions, but the experience is better with them.

## Keeping the app updated

Linkr releases updates periodically with improvements and new features. Enable automatic updates on your device to ensure you have the latest version.

Major updates will be announced through the app and on the Linkr website.

<Note>
The mobile app and web app use the same account. Sign in once and your data syncs across both.
