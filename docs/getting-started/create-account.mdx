# Creating an Account

To use Linkr — whether to discover connectivity or share your own — you need an account.

---

## What you need

- An email address
- A password

That is it. Linkr does not require phone verification, identity documents, or payment information to create an account.

---

## Creating your account

1. Open the Linkr app or visit the web app
2. Select **Create Account**
3. Enter your email address
4. Create a password
5. Verify your email through the confirmation link

Once verified, your account is active. You can immediately begin discovering hotspots or sharing your own.

---

## Account types

There is one account type on Linkr. Every account can:

- Browse the map and discover hotspots
- Connect to accessible hotspots
- Share hotspots and contribute to the network
- Manage their shared hotspots

You do not need a special account to contribute. The same account that discovers connectivity can also provide it.

---

## Account security

Your account is protected by your password. We recommend:

- Using a unique password you do not use elsewhere
- Enabling two-factor authentication when available
- Keeping your email access secure

Your account credentials control access to your contributed hotspots and your connection history.

---

## What happens after account creation

Once your account exists, you can:

- **Explore the map** — browse connectivity worldwide
- **Connect to hotspots** — access available connectivity
- **Share a hotspot** — contribute your own connectivity to the network

There is no trial period, no premium tier required for basic functionality, and no limit on how many hotspots you can share.

<Note>
Account creation takes less than two minutes. Everything else on Linkr builds from this starting point.
