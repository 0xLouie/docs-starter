## Our Philosophy

We are building Linkr because we believe connectivity is infrastructure, and infrastructure should be community-powered.

The team is small by design. We focus on building the coordination layer that enables others to contribute, not on building a massive organization ourselves.

If you are interested in what we are building, reach out. The network grows through participation.
