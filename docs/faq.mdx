# Frequently Asked Questions

---

## General

### Does Linkr replace my ISP?

No. Linkr does not provide internet service. It provides a way to share and discover connectivity that already exists.

Your ISP delivers internet to your location. If you share a hotspot through Linkr, you are sharing access to the connection your ISP provides. Linkr coordinates discovery and access — it does not replace the underlying service.

### Is Linkr a VPN?

No. Linkr is not a VPN and does not provide encryption, anonymity, or tunneling services.

When you connect to a Linkr hotspot, your traffic passes through that hotspot's network. If you need VPN functionality, use a separate VPN service.

### Who can join Linkr?

Anyone. There are no geographic restrictions, no invitation requirements, and no approval process.

Create an account, and you can immediately use the map to discover hotspots or share your own.

### What does "community-powered" actually mean?

It means the network is built by its participants, not by a central provider.

Every hotspot on Linkr was shared by a person or organization. The coverage, reliability, and reach of the network depend entirely on contributions. Linkr provides the coordination layer — the infrastructure itself comes from the community.

## Security and Privacy

### Is it safe to use Linkr hotspots?

Using a Linkr hotspot is similar to using any public Wi-Fi network. The connection between your device and the hotspot is typically encrypted (via WPA2/WPA3), but traffic beyond the hotspot travels over the contributor's network and the public internet.

Standard precautions apply:

- Use HTTPS for sensitive websites
- Consider a VPN for additional privacy
- Avoid transmitting sensitive information on untrusted networks

### Is it safe to share my hotspot?

Sharing your hotspot exposes your network to connections from others. To share safely:

- Use a guest network, isolated from your primary network
- Configure bandwidth limits to protect your own usage
- Ensure your router is updated and secured

Linkr does not inspect traffic that passes through shared hotspots. You are responsible for securing your own network.

### What data does Linkr collect?

Linkr collects:

- Account information (email, password hash)
- Hotspot metadata (location, configuration, status)
- Availability data (from network checks)
- Connection records (which accounts connected to which hotspots)

Linkr does not collect or inspect the content of traffic passing through hotspots.

### What data is visible to others?

On the map, others can see:

- Hotspot locations
- Hotspot status (online/offline)
- Reliability scores
- Access type (public/limited/private)

Others cannot see:

- Your account information
- Your connection history
- Any traffic passing through hotspots

## Using the Map

### How accurate is the map?

The map shows hotspots that have been contributed and their observed availability. It is accurate to what has been shared with the network.

Accuracy limits:

- Areas without contributions appear empty, even if connectivity exists there
- GPS accuracy affects location precision
- Status may take a few minutes to update after changes

### Why are some areas empty?

Empty areas mean no one has shared a hotspot there. It does not mean connectivity is impossible — only that nothing has been contributed to Linkr.

If you have connectivity in an empty area, consider sharing it.

### How often does the map update?

Status updates occur continuously. When a hotspot goes offline or comes back online, the map reflects this within minutes.

Reliability scores update as new availability data is collected, which happens over hours and days.

## Sharing Hotspots

### Do I need special hardware?

No. Any device that can create a wireless access point can become a Linkr hotspot — home routers, mobile phones, dedicated access points.

### Can I share my phone's hotspot?

Yes. Mobile hotspots are valid contributions. They appear on the map like any other hotspot.

Keep in mind that mobile hotspots tend to be less reliable (they move, battery dies, cellular signal varies) and may have lower reliability scores as a result.

### What happens if my hotspot goes offline?

Its status changes to offline on the map. Your reliability score is affected proportionally to the downtime.

Users cannot connect while your hotspot is offline. When it comes back online, status updates automatically.

### Can I control who accesses my hotspot?

Yes. You can configure your hotspot as:

- **Public** — anyone can connect
- **Limited** — only users meeting criteria you define
- **Private** — only users you explicitly approve

### Will sharing slow down my internet?

It can. When others connect to your hotspot, they use your bandwidth.

To manage this:

- Set bandwidth limits in your router settings
- Use a guest network with QoS restrictions
- Share during times when you have spare capacity

## Trust and Reliability

### How do I know a hotspot is reliable?

Each hotspot displays a reliability score based on observed uptime. Higher scores indicate more consistent availability.

New hotspots without enough history show as unrated until data accumulates.

### What if a hotspot does not work as shown?

Availability data is based on network checks, not user experience reports. A hotspot may pass checks but still provide poor service.

If you encounter a hotspot that does not work as expected, you can report issues through the app. Patterns of reports are monitored.

### Can I trust contributors?

Linkr verifies that hotspots exist and tracks their availability. It does not verify the identity or intentions of contributors.

Use the same judgment you would with any public network. The reliability score tells you about uptime, not about the contributor's character.

## Technical

### Does Linkr work offline?

You need connectivity to browse the live map, create accounts, and share hotspots. Cached map data may be available for offline viewing, but functionality is limited without a connection.

### What platforms does Linkr support?

- iOS (15.0+)
- Android (10+)
- Web (modern browsers)

### How do I report a bug or issue?

Contact support@linkrmap.com with a description of the issue, your device and app version, and any relevant screenshots.

## Philosophy

### Why does Linkr exist?

Connectivity is everywhere, but finding and accessing it remains difficult. Linkr exists to make local connectivity globally discoverable and accessible.

The goal is infrastructure — shared, observable, reliable, and accessible.

### Is Linkr trying to replace telecom companies?

No. Linkr complements existing infrastructure by adding a discovery and coordination layer.

Telecom companies provide the underlying connectivity. Linkr helps that connectivity become visible and shared.
